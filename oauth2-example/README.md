# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The purpose of this project is to show a basic implementation of a react app with Google OAuth2.0 login.
Due to the limits currently applied to the APIs only a limited list of users is able to join the app.
Once logged in the app shows user profile picture, name and email address.

# Installing necessary packages
 yarn install
# running on localhost
